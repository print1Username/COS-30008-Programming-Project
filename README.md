This is the Programming project for the COS 30008 Data Structure and Patterns.

## Game Descriptions
This is a lightweight RPG developed entirely in C++.

The core narrative centers around the player, a programmer, who is literally snatched from the real world and pulled into a perilous digital adventure by a pair of mysterious, unseen hands.

Gameplay involves navigating a labyrinthian environment: The player must strategically choose between different rooms, each presenting a unique combat challenge defined by varying monster quantities and threat levels. The ultimate objective is to successfully identify and secure the correct escape route needed to safely return home.
